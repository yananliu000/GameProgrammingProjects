Update Log After Final 
2020/5/25
(Based on Rez's feedback):
1. completely remove long switch in actionNode (I removed the long switch in decisionFactor before submitting final) 
2. delete unused code
3. add debug panel an alpha background 

(most based on Dylan's feedback):
1. Use Asset -> menu to create scriptable assets instead of Tools
2. Debug log gameobject to enable clicking the debug information and locate the gameobject 
3. Instead of doing a render manager to hide a rabbit. Hide the "top" of the mesh
4. use a better format to join string: 
        m_actionText.text = $"Current Action : {action.ActionDefinition.m_type}\nTarget: 	{action.Target}\nPercentage: {(int)(action.elapsedTime / 	action.ActionDefinition.m_duration * 100)}\nCurrentState: {action.State}";
